# Just Fucking Use Brain.

We are drowning in tools, frameworks, and complexities we created for ourselves. Web development has become a contest of who can overengineer the simplest solution.

It's time to stop. It's time to decouple. **It's time to think.**

## The Core Philosophy

Modern web development isn't about using the newest shiny toy. It's about architecture that makes sense. It's about separation of concerns. The days of monolithic giants rendering HTML on the server are numbered.

### 1. Decouple Everything
Your backend should be an API. Your frontend should be a consumer. Never let them know too much about each other. This is the only way to scale teams and technology independently.

### 2. Use The Right Tool
Don't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Don't use a full-stack framework for a landing page. Understand your requirements before you `bun install`.

### 3. Own Your Stack
Stop relying on "magic". Understand how HTTP works. Understand how the browser renders. Abstraction is useful, but ignorance is fatal.
